## Contents
Zytron is tailored for developers to build autonomous worlds, mini strategy games, or migrate AAA games on-chain at minimum cost without steep learning curves, enabling them to migrate assets, game logic, and data storage on-chain while preserving production-level UE to achieve world adoption for billions of gamers.

## Tools

Currently, Zytron supports most development tools in the evm ecosystem and provides standard web3 interface support. 
Currently supported development tools are:

- Openzeppelin
- Hardhat
- Foundry
- Remix
- (Other EVM related tool)

## Zytron Engines

At present, zytron has not adjusted the working mode of the standard EVM, and special functions are completed using precompiled contracts.
