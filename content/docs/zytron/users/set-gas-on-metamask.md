# Set Priority Gas in Metamask

Since zytron allows lower transaction gas support, metamask cannot be directly adapted in many cases.
Therefore, you need to manually configure the Priority Gas Price.

To enable this function, please follow these step:

1. In the send transaction interface, click Estimated fee edit button (blue button).
2. Click Advanced.
3. You can adjust the Priority Gas Price according to your needs. The larger this value, 
    the easier it is for the transaction to be confirmed by the network.
    We recommend using 0.002 as the Priority Gas Price.
4. To avoid doing this for every future transaction, please click "Save these values as my default for the..."
5. Click "Save" and comfirm transaction.
