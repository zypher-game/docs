## Contents
The z4 engine is a development framework for low latency and high performance, and help developers to build decentralized games.

It includes smart contracts, on-chain and off-chain interactions, RPC and P2P networks, game logic interfaces and game rooms management. Developers only need to focus on the game logic and will not be interfered by the blockchain, zkp and network.

Developers can freely and flexibly customize their own exclusive z4 nodes for their games, or they can use general zkVM game nodes without having to deal with any off-chain certification.

In this chapter, we will describe in detail how to customize z4 nodes and how to use general z4 nodes.

Firstly, let's install z4 command for better starting. `cargo install z4`.
