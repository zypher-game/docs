## Contents
Matchmaking is a mechanism designed to ensure fair and enjoyable gaming experiences by matching players based on their skill levels.
Its core objectives can be summarized as follows:

1. Fair Competition: Providing matchups between players of similar skill
levels to ensure a balanced probability of winning for both sides, ideally
close to 50%.

2. Unpredictability: The matchmaking process is unpredictable, meaning
the eventual opponents in a match are not foreseeable.
