## Introduction
PoZK is a prover network for ZK games.

In order to allow players to play games smoothly on various terminal devices without being restricted by zk computing power, we launched the ZK prover network to solve the problem of players' computing power.

At the same time, computing power will be rewarded. Each proof represents the correctness of the result of a game. Each proof is meaningful, so each computing power will be rewarded. Not only miners will get computing power rewards, but players will also get game rewards. Promote more games to join and more players to experience decentralized games.

Here is the architecture diagram of the entire product, illustrating the relationship between the various components (roles)

Here is an explanation of the complete workflow, from players to miners in the PoZK network.
