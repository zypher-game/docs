## Introduction
The Zypher Mining Network empowers ZK games by providing a dedicated proving infrastructure.

This network addresses the challenge of limited on-device processing power, enabling smooth gameplay across a wider range of devices. By offloading complex ZK computations, the network ensures an optimal gaming experience for all players.

Contributing to the network through proof generation is a rewarding endeavor. Each proof validates a game result, contributing to the integrity of the game and earning rewards for the prover. This dual reward system benefits both miners and players, fostering a thriving ecosystem of decentralized gaming.

The following architecture diagram illustrates the relationships between the various components (roles) within the system.
