## Contents
On the one hand, we combined R0 with the Z4 engine to help developers quickly complete the development of multiplayer online games. Developers only need to focus on the game logic, and everything else including on-chain and off-chain interactions, multi-player networks, and the generation and verification of zkp are automatically completed by the framework. [More code repo](https://github.com/zypher-game/z4)

On the other hand, we provide proof generation based on zkvm written in R0 in the mining network, using more and more powerful machines to help reduce usersâ€™ zkvm proof time.
